## Hardware vs Virtual Appliance

- *Physical Appliances* are dedicated hardware device focused on specific network functions, offering high performance and reliability but at a higher cost and with space requirements.
- *Virtual Appliances* are software-based solutions that run on virtual machines, providing similar functions with greater flexibility, scalability, and cost efficiency, but potentially at the cost of raw performance.



## Router

- Operates at the [**Network Layer (Layer 3)**](2.%20OSI%20Model.md#Network%20Layer%20-%20*3*) of the OSI model, directing data packets between different networks based on **IP addresses (DOES NOT READ MAC ADDRESSES)**.
- Uses **routing tables** to determine the best path for forwarding packets to their destination.
- Connects multiple networks together, such as a local network to the internet.
- Provides **network security features** like firewalls and VPN support.



## Switches

- Operates at the [**Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**](2.%20OSI%20Model.md#Data%20Link%20Layer%20-%20*2*) of the OSI model (some advanced switches also function at **Layer 3**).
- Uses **MAC addresses** to forward data to the correct device within a network.
- Unlike a hub, a switch **intelligently directs traffic** by sending data only to the intended recipient, reducing network congestion.
- Supports **full-duplex communication**, allowing simultaneous sending and receiving of data.
- Commonly used in **LANs (Local Area Networks)** to connect computers, printers, and other network devices efficiently.
- Can provide additional features like **VLAN support**, **port security**, and **Quality of Service (QoS)**.
- It create separate collision domains for each port, improving network efficiency by reducing collisions.

- A **data collision** occurs when two or more devices transmit data simultaneously on a shared network medium, causing interference and corruption of the data. Common in half-duplex networks.



## Firewall

- A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing traffic and decides whether to allow or block it based on a defined set or security rules.
- Are crucial for establishing a barrier between secure internal networks and untrusted external networks, such as the internet.
- Can hardware/software based or both.



## IDS and IPS

**Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**
- **Monitors** network traffic for **malicious activity**.

- **Passive system** – alerts administrators but does not take action.

**Intrusion-Prevention System (IPS)**
- **Actively blocks** malicious traffic by **dropping packets or terminating connections**.
- Requires **pre-configured rules** to identify and mitigate threats.
- Can operate at **multiple OSI layers** depending on implementation.
- **Proactive system** – prevents threats before they impact the network.


## Load Balancers

- **Distributes network traffic** across multiple servers to prevent any single server from becoming overwhelmed.
- Improves **reliability, availability, and performance** of applications.
- Operates at **multiple layers** of the OSI model, depending on the type of load balancing.
- Makes routing decisions based on:
	- **IP addresses** (Network Layer - Layer 3)
	- **TCP/UDP ports** (Transport Layer - Layer 4)
	- **Application-level content** (Application Layer - Layer 7)
- Optimizes **resource usage**, maximizes **throughput**, reduces **response time**, and prevents **server overload**.



### Proxy Servers

- Acts as an **intermediary** between a user's device and the internet.
- Receives requests from clients, forwards them to the target server, and returns the server's response to the client.
- Provides additional functionalities such as:
	- **Content caching** to improve load times and reduce bandwidth usage.
	- **Access control** to restrict or allow traffic based on policies.
	- **Filtering** to block malicious or unwanted content. Many proxy servers are also firewalls.
	- **Enhancing security** by masking client IP addresses.
	- **Performance optimization** through traffic management and compression.



## Network Attached Storage

- A **dedicated file storage device** connected to a network, allowing multiple users and devices to **store and retrieve data** from a centralized location.
- Designed for **easy file sharing, data backups, and centralized data management**.
- Supports various **file-based protocols**, including:
	- **NFS (Network File System)**
	- **SMB/CIFS (Server Message Block / Common Internet File System)**
	- **AFP (Apple Filing Protocol)**
- Provides a **scalable and cost-effective** solution for businesses and home users to **share files across different platforms and devices**.



## Storage Area Network (SAN)

- A **dedicated high-speed network** that provides access to **consolidated block-level storage (RAW storage)**.
- Uses **specialized switches** to connect storage devices and servers.
- Designed for **handling large volumes of data transfers**, improving:
	- **Availability** of storage resources.
	- **Performance** of applications by offloading storage functions.
	- **Direct access** to multiple storage devices.
- Commonly used in **enterprise environments** to enhance **storage solutions and data management**.



## Access Points and Wireless Controller

- **Allows wireless devices** to connect to a **wired network** using Wi-Fi or related standards.
- Operates at the **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**, bridging **wireless** and **wired** network segments.
- Extends the **wireless coverage** of a network.
- Manages **multiple connections simultaneously**, providing **network access** to wireless devices within range.

**Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)**
**Manages wireless access points (APs)** in a network, centralizing control of the **WLAN**.
- Simplifies the **deployment and management** of wireless networks.
- Handles:
	- **Configuration** of multiple APs.
	- **Security policies** enforcement.
	- **Guest access** management.
- Enhances the **efficiency and security** of wireless networks.



## Content Delivery Network (CDN)

- A **globally distributed network** of proxy servers and data centers designed to **deliver internet content rapidly** to users.
- **Caches content** such as web pages, videos, and images in multiple locations around the world.
- **Reduces latency** and improves **access speed** for users, regardless of their geographical location.



## Virtual Private Network (VPN)

- Creates a **secure and encrypted connection** over a less secure network, such as the **internet**.
- Allows **secure data transmission** across public networks, as if the devices were directly connected to the private network.

**User Access VPN**

**Site-to-Site VPN**
- Used to securely connect **entire networks** at different locations (e.g., branch offices) to form a **single network**.
- Often used by **large organizations** to link their corporate networks together over the internet.
- It operates between **two routers** or **gateways**, without requiring individual user authentication.
- Example: **Connecting a branch office network** to a company’s headquarters network.

**Key Differences:**
- **User Access VPN**: Focuses on individual users connecting to a private network securely.
- **Site-to-Site VPN**: Focuses on linking entire networks (e.g., two office locations) securely.



## VoIP

**Voice over Internet Protocol**

- **VoIP** is a technology that allows voice communications and multimedia sessions over the **internet** or other IP-based networks.

**Quality of Service (QOS)**
- Refers to the set of **technologies and policies** used to **manage and prioritize network traffic** to ensure the performance of critical applications and services.
- QoS assigns different **priorities** to different types of traffic, ensuring that **essential services** like **voice** and **video communications** are given **higher priority** over less critical data.
- Helps in reducing **latency**, **jitter**, and **packet loss**, enhancing the **user experience** in networks with limited bandwidth.



## TTL

**Time to Live**

- **TTL** is a field in the header of **IP packets** that specifies the **number of hops** a packet is allowed to traverse before being discarded by a router.
- **TTL** helps prevent packets from **looping indefinitely** in the network.
	- Each router **decrements** the TTL value by one.
	- When TTL reaches **zero**, the packet is **dropped**.
