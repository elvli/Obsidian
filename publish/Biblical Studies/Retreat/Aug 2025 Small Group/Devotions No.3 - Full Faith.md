### Passage

Thousands of people around the world prayed for Sethie’s three-year-old son, who’d been hospitalized for months. When doctors said Shiloh had “no meaningful brain activity,” Sethie called me.  

“Sometimes, I’m scared I’m not living with full faith,” she said. “I know God can heal Shiloh and let him come home with us. I’m also at peace if God heals him by taking him to heaven.”  

Assuring her that God understands like no one else can, I said, “You’ve surrendered to God. That is full faith!”  

A few days later, God took her precious son to heaven. Though struggling with the grief of losing him, Sethie thanked God and the many people who prayed. She said, “I believe God is still good and still God.”  

In this world, until Jesus comes again, we’ll “suffer grief in all kinds of trials” (1 Peter 1:6). We’ll need to process real emotions caused by real pain. However, everyone who experiences “new birth” in Christ (v. 3) can be anchored in life by love for Jesus and be “filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy” (v. 8). The end result of our faith in Christ is this: “the salvation of our souls” (v. 9).  

The Holy Spirit empowers us to have full faith—living with our prayers and our situations confidently surrendered to Christ.
