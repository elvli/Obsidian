### Passage

“May we invite you to be the main speaker in our nationwide church leadership conference?” After Jose read the invitation from the renowned organization, he replied, “Please let me pray about it first.”  

Later, when he turned down the offer, he told a friend, “I knew God was calling me to editorial work on a mission’s project, and the speaking engagement would take time and energy away from that. I said no so I can do what God wants me to do.”  

*What God wants me to do*—that was Jose’s priority and what determined his decision.  

Jesus also made God’s purpose His priority. The morning after healing many in Capernaum who were sick and demon-possessed, Jesus went to a solitary place to pray (Mark 1:32-35). The disciples came, saying, “Everyone is looking for you!” (v. 37). Some of those seeking Him were likely requesting healing. Christ, however, didn’t allow urgency or His sudden popularity to determine what He’d do next.  

“Let us go . . . to the nearby villages,” He said, “so I can preach there also. That is why I have come” (v. 38). Jesus followed His priority—a ministry that covered the rest of Galilee, and one that included preaching (v. 39).  

How may we know God’s purpose for us? We can approach Him in prayer, be led by His wisdom found in the Scriptures, and seek counsel from people who uphold His ways. Let’s spend our life doing what God wants us to do.
