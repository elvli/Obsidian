### Passage

With the referee’s final gesture, wrestler Kennedy Blades became a 2024 Olympian. She pressed her palms together, lifted her hands and eyes to the heavens, and praised God. A reporter asked about her growth over the past three years. The elite athlete didn’t even mention her physical training.  

“I’ve just gotten super close to Jesus,” she said. Professing Christ as King, she proclaimed that He’s coming again and encouraged others to believe in Him. “It’s Him,” she said. “That’s the main reason why I was able to accomplish such a big thing.” In other interviews, she faithfully declared that Jesus is everything to her and the reason for everything good in her life.  

This passion for living a God-centered life reflects David’s confessions in Psalm 63. Acknowledging his desperation for his creator, he said, “I thirst for you, my whole being longs for you” (v. 1). David had “seen” God and “beheld” His “power” and “glory” (v. 2). He declared God’s steadfast love as “better than life” (v. 3). Then, he prayed: “Because you are my help, I sing in the shadow of your wings. I cling to you; your right hand upholds me” (vv. 7-8). God was clearly everything to David.  

Our lives can be beacons that point others to a life-saving relationship with God when Jesus becomes our reason, our everything.

### Notes

  - Gave all glory to God, not to herself or her training  
  - Faith and relationship with Jesus were her foundation, not athletic success  
  - Used her platform to point others to Christ  
  - David longed for God more than anything else.
  - He saw God’s power and glory, and called His love “better than life”  
  - He clung to God for help, strength, and security  
  - Our lives, like Kennedy’s and David’s, can reflect where our hope and joy truly come from  
  - Do people see self-reliance or God-reliance in us?  
	  - When life is going well, do we give ourselves the credit or point to God’s provision?
	  - In times of struggle, do we try to handle everything in our own strength, or do we openly show dependence on prayer and God’s guidance?
  - Living with Jesus as our “everything” means our words, choices, and attitudes point back to Him
