Romans 12:1-2

- What is the way of the world?
- What is the way of God?
- What is the will of God?

The way of the world is not obvious. It’s insidious and creeps into our lifestyles.

You can call yourself Christian and still be a product of this world.

We are all primarily products of our thinking.

If you’re mostly depending on a secular world view, you don’t know god yet.



The way of god involves thinking differently, be transformed by the renewing of your mind.

A renewed heart leads to salvation and redemption, but only if with a renewed mind. You’ll become better at discernment.

You not meant to find the will of god in the Bible, you can find principles to help you better understand his will. You need a renew heart and mind to understand.



So many Christians prefer the worldly values, what then distinguishes you from everyone else.
