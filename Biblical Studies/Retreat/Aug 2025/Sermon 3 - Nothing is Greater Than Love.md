Revelations 2:1-7

Revelations was composed by apostle John, all the other apostles have been martyred.

Churches have forgotten heir first love. Though they can recite scripture and such, they have no heart and are empty. E.g. Church of Ephesus.

Nothing is greater than love.

Faith can be built on things other than love. Upbringing, for example

The foundation of some people’s face comes for the teachings and faith of others. 

If it ever becomes just about trying to earn it, working for his approval, rather than from it , we’ve lost the point. Everything we do should come from love. 

You have to give up created and material things, they are al secondary things that come along for the ride. 

Fear can only go so far

Fall back and love the lord
