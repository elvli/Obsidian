John 5:1-15

In this story Jesus initiated this interaction. He is also very open with this man, at this point in his life, the was keeping this power very low key, to not draw attention from the pharasies. He saw that this man needed a very direct approach

- What was the invalids problem?
- What was his solution?
- What was Jesusâ€™s solution?

Excuses are the gateway to our soul, they show internal issues. A deep internal paralysis, a passivity

They found solidarity in people that are in the same state is brokenness. They choose to stay there because of the familiarity and comfortableness. It becomes normal.

The brokenness becomes a shield. Instead of taking action, there become defensive about it and start blaming others, deflecting.

Many of our solutions sat not any better than the invalids, we need that external intervention.

Ask the lord: what is the pinpoint of our paralysis?
