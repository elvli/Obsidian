“What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?” - Jesus according to Matthew 

Luke is trying to show people who are unfamiliar with scripture, the life is Jesus

Luke 9:51, Luke 13:22, Luke 15:1-2, Luke 16:15-16

What people value highly is detestable on God’s sight

The parable, the rich man and Lazarus: Luke 16:19-31
- this is the only parable with a name in the title
- Lazarus is covered in sores
- the parable was speaking to the Pharisees who sneered at Jesus
- The rich man didn’t go to hell for being evil, he was sent there since he was indifferent and didn’t notice the poor man

Jesus is trying to help whose with wealth, since wealth becomes burdensome. People become too focused on their worldly life.
