Philippians 1:27-30; 2:1-18

Paul came to Rome and stayed there for two years at his own expense.

Let your manner of life be worthy of the Gospel of Christ

Conflicts in the Church of Philippi

1. Disunity
	1. Caused by selfish ambition or conceit (Philippians 1:17)
	2. Due to grumbling or disputing
	3. The attitude and manner you have says a lot about you
	4. We should live in humility
	5. If you’re humble, you stop acting out of selfishness. You curb any conceited habits
	6. Put yourself aside and help others get ahead.
	7. You should have the same attitude as christ
2. Sufferings
	1. Fear and trembling - not in the sense of being afraid, but rather in the sense of awe which comes when we contemplate God’s work of amazing grace in Christ
	2. Paul had joy in suffering when he was at a low point
	3. Grow through that suffering
	4. St. Ignacious was mauled by lions and still praised God (Acts 16:24)
3. Opponents 
	1. Out of envy and rivalry 
	2. Paul’s repeated appeals to the church to be united in spirit and of one mind. Same Christ-like humility and attitude 
	3. No point in mutilating yourself, you should change your heart.
	4. KC’s example of cutting his fingers off to stop gambling. But if your heart is wanting something, you’ll still find a way to do it
