1 Samuel 1:20-22, 24-28

God has already been giving us his best, when we give him the best, we are just returning it.

1. Returning the best means bringing the best
	1. Giving the best means what’s best to us
	2. Hannah asked God for a son, and promised to give her son to God
	3. It’s only because Jesus first gave us the best
2. Returning the best means readying the best
	1. Hannah was readying her son, Samuel, to be serving the temple forever
3. Returning the best means offering the best
	1. Means it’s finally ready, and we will offer the best
	2. Offering is from the heart
	3. If you love someone, you would offer them the best.
	4. The same goes for Jesus, if you love him, you would always want to give him the best
	5. God, a loving father, would always give us the best

Reminding ourselves that we do all for the glory of God. When we do, it is most fulfilling.
