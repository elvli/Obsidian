2 Chronicles - 11:2-4, 13-17

God’s world view is the most importantly world view. Other work diminish the preciousness of human life. 

1. Let God lead
	1. Without him we’re just wandering alone in the woods
2. Don’t lose sight
	1. God is the light
	2. When God was first, everything was prospering
3. God Will bless
