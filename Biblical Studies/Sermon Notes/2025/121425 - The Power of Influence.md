2 Chronicles 33-35

Ch. 33 King Manasseh
- did evil in the sight of the Lord
- He rebuilt the high places. Erected altars to Baal, Asheroth all the “hosts of heaven” (verse 3)
- Built altars in the house of the Lord said His presence would be (verse 4)

Back worship - fertility and weather God
- forms of worship included
	- Prostitution
	- Sacrificing
	- Self harm and chanting 

God punished Manasseh and was humbled. He recognized that he needed God’s influence in his life.

Worldly influence leads to a mindset that can be destructive, or lead into a state where to don’t value the things that God values and lead you away from him. With God in mind, you don’t understand that dis move is enough. With a God driven church rot will find perky that care for you as a fellow Christian.

God influence is what leads you.

First you have to understand the band of Christian values.

1. We seek to understand values of Christian beliefs (dealing with hypocrisy and having a changed mindset)
	1. King Josiah gets rid of an potential bad influences
	2. He treasures the laws, does not see them as hate but as mercy. He gives us real hope, not fake or misleading
2. We must remember and remember the times we have with God (not just each other)
	1. Bad mindset king Manasseh
		1. These acts are harmless
		2. God didn’t strike them down yet, so it must be good
		3. Everything that hardens before was coincidence
			1. His father and Hezekiah just needed to “cope” so they brought God into the picture
	2. Remember God and his influence
		1. With remembering you will lose value to God
	3. Prayer life us important so that you can have times to value as well
	4. If you’re only asking for things in prayer, it’s one sided. It’s not a proper prayer life
3. Be firm in you faith (not out of arrogance but out of understanding)
	1. Sharpen one another
	2. Don’t be afraid to share your knowledge
	3. King Josiah did this. He made a covenant with God to stand firm

With gods influence you will have clarity

How do we spend time with God?
- prayer
	- entails listens to God, quieting your heart

Why are we trying to please others when we’re following Christ
