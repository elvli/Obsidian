2 Chronicles 29:1-36

If you want to renew something, you have to repair it. It’s the same for relationships/people.

Not always like father like son. You can break that chain of wickedness.

If your relationship it’s in fire with God, everything will go accordingly to gods plan.

Renewal shouldn’t be outwardly, it should be in your spirit
