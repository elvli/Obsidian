Offering to gift is not natural but it reminds us of the giving of ourselves

Malachi 3:6-10
If we don’t give offering, you could say that we’re robbing God. Not offering is not giving the back or the provider.

Leviticus 27:30
Mark 12:41-44
2 Corinthians 9:6-8
Luke 16:10-13

1. Wealth is either used in service to God 
2. Or unfaithful in service of yourself

If we’re faithful with little, we can be sure that God can trust us with much more.

God promises that he would multiple the faithfulness we give to him.
