2 Chronicles 24-26

1. You will do the right thing
2. You will listen to his counsel
3. You will finish well

When we have god as the central focus in life, rather than people, we are better prepared to exercise discernment.

Don’t depend on others faith. You won’t be able to discern what in your own heart. 

Make your worshiping god and the upkeep of his house the central part of your life. Give him the best.

It’s important to build that relationship with God for yourself. Don’t depend on others for your faith. Personally trust in the lord.

Surround yourself with mentors and advisors who are grounded in biblical truth and can guide you in righteousness.

We have to respect God’s boundaries in life.

Remain steadfast in your faith, even when those who have guided you are no longer present.

Guard against idolatry. Be vigilant against influences that draw you away from God, ensuring that he remains the center of your life.
