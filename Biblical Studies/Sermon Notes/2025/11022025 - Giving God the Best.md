2 Thessalonians 3:6-13

When the world thinks of work, they think of survival. 
Work was created to be joyful and full of meaning.

“The Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it.”
‭‭Genesis‬ ‭2‬:‭15‬ ‭ESV‬‬

Adam was a manager of creation. Work had purpose and meaning.

Rest is not just sleep. Rest is us coming to church, fellowshipping. 

Work should be viewed as a higher calling, it shows how God is. Our work should reflect God.

A lot of times we’re giving God our leftovers, while God is giving us his best. We should be giving him our best.

Thessalonians 2:6-13
People were tired and gave up on fellowshipping and worship because they were tired

Fellowship and worship provides a spiritual rest that we can’t be fulfilled in any other way

How to treat fellowship as rest
- love God first

We shouldn’t get tired doing the good works for god

1. If we want to give God the best, we will work hard
2. If we want to give God the best, we will work purposefully
3. If we want to give God the best, we don’t give up
	1. Never getting tired reflects who God is
	2. He doesn’t stop working
	3. He doesn’t turn to evil
