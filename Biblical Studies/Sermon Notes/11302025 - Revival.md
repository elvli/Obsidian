2 Chronicles 30:1-6, 13-20

We often cover God with items, money, other things that are important to us. Doing this we lose focus in God.

Psalm 80:1-3

1. Revival begins with return
	1. There was a call for a Judah to return to worship, to return to God.
2. Revival requires removal
	1. There’s a lot of things that we want to hold on to from the past and don’t want to let go of.
	2. Revival requires us to remove these things.
	3. Includes labels that we have given ourselves and lived accordingly too.
3. Revival causes God to listen
	1. Set your heart to seek the lord
	2. God hears his children
	3. Are we ready to have God label us?

Never too late to return
