2 Chronicles 14-16

When you fix your eyes on the lord:
1. There will be peace
2. You will be prepared for all eventualities 
3. You will persevere is days of trouble

There is no peace like the peace that reigns in the hearts of those who have purified their lives and are living in a simple, non deceptive manner before God.

If you forsake him, he will forsake you.

When you read the Bible, you donâ€™t pick and choose what to listen to and what you hear. You have to listen to everything
