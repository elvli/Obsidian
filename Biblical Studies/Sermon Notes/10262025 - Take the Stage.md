2 Chronicles 21:4-6, 11-15; 23:16-21

God is the only idol that is good to worship

- When God takes the stage of our hearts, we know what’s right 
	- God wants us to remove what’s on the stage and only have room for him there. 
		- Ex. Jeddy made that if he loves his daughter more than God, any form of discipline will not be there. He will cave in for Chloe. He’ll become obsessive.
		- If you idolize something else, you will stray away
	- Good wants us to put on his lenses so we know what’s right in his eyes
	- God treats sin equally, because he's perfectly loving, he’s perfectly just

- If we want God to take the stage, we listen to his counsel
	- king jahorom did not let God take the stage of his heart, and he suffered the consequences 


- If we want God to take the stage, we need to clear the stage
	- We’ll get stressed out when we try to take control, he’s the only one meant to have full control
	- Analogy of the janitor, God comes in and just sweeps away the clutter, distractions 

1 Corinthians 2:14-16

2 Chronicles 21:11-15

If God is so loving, why do these things happen?
- We have free will
- He can’t just let things slide because he is perfectly just
