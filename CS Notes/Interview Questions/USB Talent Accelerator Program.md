The Role:
# AI and Data Engineering

The Talent Accelerator – AI and Data Engineering stream focuses on developing skills in three key areas:  
software engineering practices, data handling and analysis, and machine learning.

The AI & Data Engineering common skill stream aims to build an individual's core set of skills and competencies in these areas and expose them to a wide range of projects that rapidly develop their proficiency.

Domain-level knowledge is acquired by being embedded within specialist areas of the Technology Services organization.

# Skills to Help Hit the Ground Running

## Soft and Professional Skills
Individuals are not expected to have polished soft or professional skills, but should demonstrate the fundamentals of professional behavior and a willingness to learn.

They should be able to communicate at a basic level, listen actively, and ask for clarification when needed.

Professionalism includes punctuality, reliability, and respectful conduct. They should be able to work cooperatively within a team, follow instructions from senior colleagues, and accept feedback positively.

## Software Engineering Practices (including Python)
Before joining the program, individuals should ideally have basic experience with core software engineering practices, including Python and simple React scripting.

Incoming participants should understand the basics of programming:  
variables and data types, loops, conditionals, functions, importing and using libraries, and basic debugging.

They should also be familiar with Git repositories and tools such as GitHub or GitLab.

## Data
A foundational understanding of data is essential.

This includes basic proficiency in data handling, manipulation, and analysis. Candidates should be comfortable working with structured and unstructured data and beginning to understand concepts such as data types, cleaning, normalization, and exploratory data analysis.

Familiarity with databases (such as SQL) and basic statistics is helpful.

## Cloud
Candidates should have familiarity with core concepts of cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

This includes understanding how to deploy and manage virtual machines, use storage services, and grasp networking basics.

Additional helpful skills include working with containers (such as Docker) and orchestration tools (such as Kubernetes), as well as navigating cloud consoles and command-line interfaces.

At this stage, understanding principles and workflows is more important than mastering individual tools.

## My Background

I graduated from Stony Brook University with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and completed NPower’s Networking and System Administration program. Since then, I’ve worked as a full stack developer building user-focused applications.

Most recently, at PlasticsNxt, I worked with the LAMP stack, leveraging Laravel to overhaul the front-end styling, optimize existing features, and build new components that enhanced user engagement and strengthened monetization.

Before that, at InkWorks Printing Inc., I built a full MERN e-commerce platform that allowed users to design and customize apparel. I worked across the stack, handled everything from the designing and implementing the React/Tailwind frontend to creating routes, building REST API, authentication systems, and CI/CD deployment pipelines.

I enjoy the full development process, from idea to deployment, and I’m looking for a team that will let me explore new technologies, broaden my technical depth, and keep growing as a developer.


#### Why are you interested in this opportunity and what drives you?

I’m interested in this opportunity because it offers something I’ve been missing: real mentorship. Working at startups has given me a lot of responsibility early on, and I’ve worked closely with founders and owners, learning how the business operates and how technology supports it. But being the highest-level developer there also meant I didn’t have more experienced engineers to guide me. I’ve learned to figure things out on my own, but I know I would grow faster and more effectively with proper mentorship and exposure to established engineering practices.

What drives me is the desire to fill that gap — to learn from experts, to understand how large-scale systems are built and maintained, and to continue expanding beyond what I can learn on my own. The Talent Accelerator’s combination of training, rotations, and support from industry professionals is exactly the kind of environment I’ve been looking for to become a stronger and more well-rounded engineer.
