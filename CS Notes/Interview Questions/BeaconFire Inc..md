# Phone Screening Notes

## My Background

I graduated from Stony Brook University with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and completed NPower’s Networking and System Administration program. Since then, I’ve worked as a full stack developer building user-focused applications.

Most recently, at a startup called PlasticsNxt, I worked with Laravel and MySQL to modernize front-end styling, restructure backend routing and controllers, and build features that improve user engagement and monetization.

Before that, at InkWorks Printing Inc., I built a full MERN e-commerce platform that allowed users to design and customize apparel. I worked across the stack, handled everything from the designing and implementing the React/Tailwind frontend to creating routes, building REST API, authentication systems, and CI/CD deployment pipelines.

I enjoy the full development process — from idea to deployment — and I’m looking for a team that values clean code and creative problem solving.

## Why I’m Interested

BeaconFire values technical excellence and professional growth. Many employees mention strong training and good opportunities for advancement, which really appeals to me.

BeaconFire also works with companies across multiple industries. My previous startup experience taught me how closely technology ties into business operations, and I’m excited about the chance to work on diverse projects, learn new technologies, and continue growing as a developer.

---

## What I’m Looking For

I’m looking for an environment where I can grow by learning from more experienced developers.  
Most of my experience so far has been self-taught — through documentation, debugging, and hands-on development — and I want more opportunities for mentorship, collaboration, and exposure to best practices.

## Team Project Example

One project that stands out is a Map Graphics Editor I built with a team of four.

We started by meeting to plan features, scope, deadlines, tech stack, and how to divide tasks.  
I focused on the frontend using React, building an intuitive interface with responsive map editing tools and managing state interactions with backend logic.

We met twice a week to share updates, raise issues, and adjust our plan. Consistent communication helped keep the project on track.

## Strengths

- One of my biggest strengths is how adaptable and proactive I am when learning new technologies. A good example is my current role: during the interview process, most of the conversation centered around React and JavaScript, so I assumed I’d be working in a typical MERN stack environment. When I joined, I found out the entire codebase was built on PHP and Laravel, a language framework I had never touched before. Instead of feeling overwhelmed, I stepped up immediately. I dove into documentation, studied the existing codebase, and built small features to understand the architecture. Within a short time, I was contributing to core features, refactoring pages for better structure, and helping modernize the front end. That experience showed me that I can pick up new tools quickly and deliver value even outside my comfort zone.

- Another strength of mine is that I take accountability for my work. I follow through on tasks, communicate early when I hit roadblocks, and take responsibility for both my successes and my mistakes. When something doesn’t go as planned, I don’t try to shift blame — I focus on understanding what happened, fixing it, and learning from it so the same issue doesn’t repeat. I think this mindset has helped me build trust with my teammates and manage my work more effectively.

## Weakness

Planning too far into the future can be difficult. When unexpected issues arise, they can slow momentum.

I address this by applying the mindset of “slow is smooth, smooth is fast.”  
I pause, reassess the situation carefully, communicate with the team, and make deliberate adjustments instead of rushing — which helps avoid bigger problems and keeps progress consistent.
