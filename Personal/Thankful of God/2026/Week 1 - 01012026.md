For the time I got to spend at the NYE party. It was a fun an happy time.

I got to talk to Jeddy and voice some of my worries and open up a bit.

Spent time Saturday night with the Church and Angela at Myron and Alison's engagement party. I was very worked up from my parents' talk so attending the party was a fun and relaxing time. Jeddy as also more than willing to talk to my parents, read them bible verses, and just be honest with them the truth. 

I was really thankful for a calm night when I got home too. It didn't have to talk to anyone, and was just able to shower and sleep
